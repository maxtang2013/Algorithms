    //Even with the BÃ©zout's identity, I think it's necessary to prove that every z = ax - by in range [0, x+y] can be measured.
    //
    //Proof by INDUCTION.
    //If we can measure all z' = a'x - b'y with (a' + b') < (a+b), then we must also be able to measure z = ax - by, if 0 <= ax - by <= x+y.
    //
    //Notice that either (a-1) * x - by, or ax - (b-1)y must also be in the range [0, x+y].
    //If not, we must have (a-1) * x - by < 0, and ax - (b-1) * y > x + y, witch lead to ax - by < x and, ax - by > x. Conflicting!
    //
    //By assumption, both (a-1) * x - by* and ax - (b-1)y are measurable, if they are in range[0, x+y]
    //If 0 <= (a-1) * x - by <= x + y, with 0 <= ax - by <= x+y, we have 0 <= (a-1) * x - by <= y,
    //so we must be able to dump all (a-1)x-by litres of water into the second jug, after that, we fill the first jug with water and get z = ax - by litres of water.
    //
    //Otherwise if 0 <= ax - (b-1)y <= x + y, with 0 <= ax - by <= x+y, we can get y <= ax - (b-1)y.
    //After we get ax - (b-1)y litres of water in the tow jugs, we can fulfill the second jug (and empty it), the amount of water left in the first jug will be z = ax - by.
